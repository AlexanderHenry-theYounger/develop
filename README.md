 # What this branch contains:

* A new class Coordinates to be used instead of x, y parameters
* the fixes from optimizations2
* several changes of variables from int to the more specifix XYZTypes
* some other changes that were convenient to write during the merge with optimizations2 (I did not make separate commits because the merge did not complete successfully without them)
