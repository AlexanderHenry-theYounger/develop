# Beta Release We The People v4.0-beta1
**!!!this is still incomplete!!!**

## Important installation instructions
This branch uses Intel Threading Building blocks to achieve concurrent AI calculations in order to speed up the AI (inter)turn. 
Before you start:

**copy tbb.dll and tbbmalloc.dll from "Project Files\tbb" to the directory where Colonization.exe resides!**

Otherwise the mod will not work!

* Attacking a stack of civilian units with a unit having the "multiple attacks per turn" promotion can cause some of the civilian units to disappear ([#582](https://github.com/We-the-People-civ4col-mod/Mod/issues/582))
* Combat Forecast sometimes not shown ([#557](https://github.com/We-the-People-civ4col-mod/Mod/issues/557))
